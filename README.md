# 👋 Hey there, I'm a Python Engineer in Data and Analytics.
<p>I am a Data Scientist and Engineer with over a decade of experience in building and optimizing end-to-end data systems. My expertise encompasses the entire data lifecycle, from designing user interfaces and capturing data through APIs to processing, storing, and transitioning data into lakes and warehouses for machine learning and analytics. I have extensive experience with tools such as Python, R, and SQL for programming; Tableau, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data visualization; and cloud platforms like AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, and BigQuery for scalable data solutions. Over the years, I have designed and implemented scalable ETL pipelines capable of processing over 10 million records daily, ensuring efficient data transformation and actionable insights. My work in data migration includes transitioning over 500TB of data from MongoDB to Snowflake and PostgreSQL with 100% accuracy, while enhancing scalability by 40% and reducing processing time by 30% through innovations like integrating Dask with FastAPI. Additionally, I have developed dashboards monitoring over 50 KPIs, providing real-time insights that improved forecast accuracy by 20%, reduced operational costs by 10%, and contributed to a 25% year-over-year growth in business performance. My strong background in system design and optimization allows me to deliver a seamless data journey, enabling a 360-degree view of user lifecycles and supporting critical decision-making. I am also proficient in version control systems like Git and GitHub for collaborative development, and I have implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitLab and Jenkins to streamline workflows. My passion lies in transforming complex datasets into meaningful narratives that empower organizations to make data-driven decisions. Whether it’s developing machine learning models, creating interactive visualizations, or designing data pipelines, I am committed to delivering high-impact solutions that drive growth and innovation.</p>
